**Registration and other details will be updated soon.**
	
**Where:** *University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI*

**When:** *July 10/11/12, 2017*

## Objectives
 1. Discuss the state-of-the-art in turbulence modeling
 2. Place some of the newer developments in RANS modeling (such as Uncertainty Quantification, data-driven modeling) in the context of main-stream turbulence modeling.
 3. Explore synergies between turbulence theory, ‘traditional’ turbulence modeling routes and `emergent’ ideas
 4. Discuss expectations (and “glass-ceiling”) of turbulence models in analysis, design and decision-making
 5. Discuss the extent to which  RANS can be employed in a Wall-modeled LES setting
 6. Provide input for a position paper on the status of turbulence modeling and a vision for the future

## Format
 - 4 plenary talks : 30 min each
 - Contributed talks : 15 min each
 - White board discussions : 1 hour each
 - 1 session on progress towards the NASA RCA validation workshop

Talks (no paper) are solicited in areas related to the objectives of the symposium. For example: Near-wall turbulence modeling; DNS/LES focused towards improving/developing turbulence models; data-driven turbulence modeling; uncertainty quantification as related to turbulence modeling; Non-equilibrium turbulence modeling; PDF methods; turbulence theory; advanced second moment closures; novel use of turbulence models; thoughts/predictions regarding the future of turbulent flow prediction; industry perspectives, etc.
